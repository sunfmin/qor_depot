    %{<p>
       <em>Web Design for Developers</em> will show you how to make your
       web-based application look professionally designed. We'll help you
       learn how to pick the right colors and fonts, avoid costly interface
       and accessibility mistakes -- your application will really come alive.
       We'll also walk you through some common Photoshop and CSS techniques
       and work through a web site redesign, taking a new design from concept
       all the way to implementation.

Product.create(:title => 'Debug It!',
  :description => 
    %{<p>
        Professional programmers develop a knack of unerringly zeroing in on
        the root cause of a bug. They can do that because they've written a
        lot of buggy code and then gained experience fixing it. This book
        captures all this experience -- use it, and you'll find you write fewer
        bugs, and the ones you do write will become easier to hunt down.
